Convolutional Matrix


Gx
-1 0 1 multiply these by the color values and add together (do this for red, green and blue)
-2 0 2
-1 0 1

Gy
-1 -2 -1
 0  0  0
 1  2  1 
 
Compute Gx and Gy for each channel of red, green, and blue
- For pixels at the border, treat any pixel beyond the border as having all 0 values
- Each new channel value should be sqrt(Gx^2 + Gy^2)
