Take a CSV file of all of the hogwarts students and write a Python program that will import all
    of that data into a sqlite database where the database will have a single table called students
    with columns (first, middle, last, house, birth).
    
Note that there are columns for first, middle, and last name in the table, however, the CSV file
    only has a column for names. The middle column could be NULL if the student does not have a middle
    name in the CSV. 
    
TASKS

import.py: Inserting data into the database
    1. Require a single CLI and print an error/exit if the incorrect number of arguments is given
    2. Open CSV file given by command-line argument (use csv.reader)
    3. For each row, parse the name (string split and slicing, and use None for student's
        middle name if they do not have one))
                
                Code for taking a single name and splicing into separat first, middle, and last
                    name = row[0]
                    sname = name.split()

                    if len(sname) != 3:
                        sname.insert(1, 'None')
        
    4. Insert each student into the students table of students.db (Use db.execute)


roster.py: reading data from that database and presenting back to the user
    1. Check CLI
    2. Query database for all students in house
        Use db.execute to SELECT rows from the table
            Return value will be a list of Python dicts, where each dict represents a row in the table (keys are columns and values are the values in that column)
        Remember to check for NULL values for middle names
    3. Print out each student's full name and birth year
    4. Students should be sorted alphabetically by last name, then first name
