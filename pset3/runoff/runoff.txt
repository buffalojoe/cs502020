Runoff Vote
    Every voter ranks their preferences

    If a candidate has a majority (more than half) of the votes, they are the winner

    Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes and re-run the election without them

Understanding the 2D array
    int preferences[MAX_VOTERS][MAX_CANDIDATES]
        preferences[0][0] = 0 means the first voters first preference equals the first candidate
        preferences[2][1] = 2 means the third voters second preference equals the third candidate


vote function: bool vote(int voter, int rank, string name)
    taking (i, j, name) in main
    Where:
        i = Query for Voter Number (1 - Number of Voters)
        j = Query for names by rank (1 - Number of Candidates)
        name = Candidate Name

vote function
1. If name is a match for the name of a valid candidate, you should update the global
    preferences array to indicate that the voter has that candidate as their rank preference.
       - Check the name value passed to the voter function voter(voter, rank, name)
       - Iterate through the candidates array to check for a match
       - Update the preferences array using preferences[voter][rank] = candidate location
       - IF no candidate is found, don't update any preferences and return false

tabulate function
* Update vote counts for all non-eliminated candidates
* Recall that each voter votes for their highest preference candidate who has
    not yet been eliminated

print_winner function
* If any candidate has more than half the vote, print out their name and return true

find_min function
* Return the minimum number of votes of anyone still in the election

is_tie function
* Decide whether or not this election is tied between the remaining candidates
* Accepts the minimum number of votes min as input
* Returns true if the election is tied between all remaining candidates, and returns false if otherwise
