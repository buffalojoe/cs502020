First row of CSV file has name as the first column, and then STRs for each of the remaining columns
Each remaining row corresponds to a person.

A sequence of DNA is also provided in several txt files.

STEPS
    1. Open the CSV file and the DNA sequence and read contents into memory
        Python's csv module has reader and DictReader
        Python's sys module gives you access to sys.argv for CLIs
        Open a text file using f = open(filename), and read it's contents using f.read()
    2. For each STR, compute the longest run of consecutive repeats in the DNA sequence (text file)
        Through the DNA sequence, compute for every position within the DNA sequence how many times the STR repeats
        For each position in the sequence: compute how many times the STR repeats starting at that position
            For each position, keep checking successive substrings until the STR repeats no longer
            At the end, you'll want to keep track of the max number of times a particular STR repeats in sequence
        len(s) in Python will get you the length of the string s
        s[i:j] in Python takes the string s, and returns the substring with all characters from the ith character up to (but not including) the jth
    3. Compare the STR counts against each row in the CSV file
        Save STR counts in some data strcture
        For each row in the data, check is each STR count matches. If so, print out the person's name
